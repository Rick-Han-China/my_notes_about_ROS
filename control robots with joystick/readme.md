## you can also attach your end_effector to your system and add code to control it in this file.
## also, you can control robot with jotsticks in moveit, but I think it is a litte complex because you have to pay attention to many launch files, why not just use one python file and some existing library to achieve your goal?
##  many functions with annotations can make this file better, but to make it work easier on Raspberry Pi, I did not use them.
